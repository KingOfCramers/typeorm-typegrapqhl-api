## DB Setup

This folder includes some useful files if you're using PostgresSQL and/or Postman.

The `seed.sql` file can be run to seed your development database with the data that I'm using in my examples.

The `postman.json` file can be imported into Postman in order to quickly see a few example queries you could make on the data. Of course, in development, you can always access the `/playground` route to make queries of your own.
