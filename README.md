# ðŸš€ Dockerized TypeORM API w/ Apollo

This is a GraphQL API that connects to SQLite in development and Postgres in production. Dockerized for faster deployment.

## Installation

This application uses `docker-compose` to ensure a consistent environment for the API. Running it in either development or production requires just a few steps.

### Development

1. Define any additional variables for development inside a `.env.development` file. By default, the `.env.development` file only requires the `PORT` on which the API will be exposed on your local machine.
2. Run the `docker-compose` script to start up your instance: `docker-compose docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up` which will run your API locally. Take note that if you're running this for the first time, it'll take a few minutes to download the images and install all the dependencies. Subsequent startups will be fast. The entire bundle is ~500MB.

### Production

1. If you're running this on EC2 (or another cloud provider with minimal configuration) you'll need docker-compose, docker, and git. Run the `setup.sh` script to download and configure them.
2. Define configuration variables that will allow TypeORM to connect to your remote database, inside a `.env.production` file. These will be passed into the `ormconfig.js` file at runtime. Presumably you do not want your database dockerized with this application, although that is possible, and indeed how this is built for development. See the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file for more information. Look at the `modules.d.ts` to see what is required configuration for your production environment (basically just PostgresSQL connection options).
3. Run the `docker-compose` command: `docker-compose docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d` which will run your service in detached mode.

## Playground

In development, the API will be accessible at the `http://localhost:1234/graphql` endpoint. You can easily test the DB with the following mutation:

```
mutation {
  addHouseHearing(
    input: {
      title: "hi"
      date: "2020-12-16T23:56:29.931Z"
      time: "2020-12-16T23:56:29.931Z"
      location: "a"
      text: ""
      chamber: "house"
      committee: "hfac"
      link: "google.com"
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

This should return the ID of the new data. Congratulations, your database and API are up and running!
